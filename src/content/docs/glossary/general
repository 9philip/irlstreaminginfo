Here are some of the miscellaneous technical terms that IRL streamers use to confuse their viewers :D

## What is Connection Bonding?
For IRL Streamers, it means harnessing multiple internet connections simultaneously to stream your live video. 

In more technical terms, it is known as link aggregation, and it enables the streamer to utilise various cellular networks, or ISPs, or even satellite connections, all at once for increased stream stability and quality.

## What is Drop Protection?
Also known as disconnect protection, it is a broad term to describe preventing your stream from ever losing connection to the end platform (Twitch/Kick/Youtube etc).
