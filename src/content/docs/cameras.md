## Which phones work well?
All modern iPhones work great as IRL Streaming cameras thanks to the livestreaming app Moblin. Specifically the iPhone 17 Pro/Max perform incredibly for IRL Streaming, not only because of the excellent cameras but above all because of the excellent built in cooling. The aluminium unibody design and internal vapour chamber prevent the risk of overheating in any normal situation. Older models may face overheating issues if in direct sunlight, using more of Moblin's features, or streaming at higher resolutions such as 4K.

As for Android, different manufacturers will grant streaming apps like IRL Pro differing levels of access to the phone's camera system.
For that reason, only certain models have camera stabilisation while streaming such as Galaxy S23 Ultra, S24 Ultra, S25 Ultra, Pixel 7 or higher.
Pixel phones are typically more prone to overheating than Samsungs. 
I am not aware of any other android phone models that have decent camera support for live streaming apps.

## Which mirrorless cameras work well?
Any mirrorless camera with clean HDMI or USB (UVC) output, and without overheating issues over long streams on hot days.

Cameras like Sony FX30, Sony FX3, Lumix GH7, Lumix S5 II output clean HDMI and are very dependable thanks to the built in fan.
